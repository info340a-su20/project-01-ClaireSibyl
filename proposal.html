       <h2>Problem Domain</h2> 
            <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400910/RabiRibi/">Rabi-ribi</a> is a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">bullet hell</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania#:~:text=Metroidvania%20is%20a%20subgenre%20of,games%20from%20these%20two%20series.">metroidvania</a> video game. So, it has boss fights where the player has to dodge a variety of attack patterns in order to survive (while simultaneously hitting the boss to defeat it).
                However, it can be difficult for players to figure out how to dodge some attack patterns for a boss. Some may seem almost impossible to not get hit by. 
                While there are methods to become invulnerable for a second or so (dubbed invisibility frames), these are limited so players may still want to figure out how to be able to dodge an attack pattern without utilizing their limited invisibility frame actions.
                If players want to seek help in figuring it out, the best that they seem to be able to do is look at YouTube videos of the boss fights, find the pattern they are struggling with, and then hope the person was able to dodge it. 
                There's also a <a href="https://rabidb.com/">database website</a>, but it doesn't have information on attack pattern dodging. 
                On Youtube, some players may upload videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtkZim3AmlA">this</a> where they do not get hit the entire fight, or a video where they focus on a particular pattern such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2PUkJPQ1sE">this</a>, but there is still not a complete list for all bosses and attack patterns.
                Plus, it can be a hassle looking all over Youtube for different people's videos, rather than a single entity that contains everything and has navigation to help find what you're looking for right away (ie. a website dedicated to it, or a playlist even).                
                Thus, there isn't really a hub where you can find this information easily.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>For players that want help in figuring out (or remembering) how to dodge Rabi-ribi's multitude of boss bullet hell attack patterns, I propose a website that is dedicated to this problem.
                The website can break down each fight, by boss, then by attack pattern. So, there can be pages for each boss and clips for each attack pattern under their page. Written tips or alternative methods of dodging can be included, too.
                These video clips can be recorded by me, or taken (and cited) from existing YouTube videos that showcase a no-hit no-invincibility-frame-ability example of the attack pattern.
                So, users who want to learn about an attack they can't figure out or remember can come to this site, look up the boss fight, then find the attack pattern within the page. 
                Additionally, in case there is a problem with the website, perhaps a Help page can be provided to send in an email to me if the website is bugging out or otherwise has some sort of problem (ie. incorrect information, typo, etc.)
                There can also be an "About" page to explain what the website is for, as well.  
            </p>   
            <p>
                This will help players learn to dodge the fight's attack patterns without randomly looking at YouTube uploads of the fight in hopes of finding a person who can dodge it without using the invisibility frame abilities
                (or in hopes that a person made a no-hit of the fight or pattern). It solves the problem because doing the aforementioned alternative can be a long process and in some cases, waste time if someone were to look through videos of clears (that aren't marked no-hit) and end up not finding the attack pattern (which may not be used) or end up finding someone who got hit or used an invincibility frame ability.
                Even in no-hit videos, most aren't marked as "no-hit" AND "no invincibility frame abilities" (or marked in similar words that mean the same thing); so someone could find a no-hit with the person using the abilities, anyways.
                Thus, this website will guarantee a player that they can find the information they need, and be able to find it very easily in comparison to the alternative.
