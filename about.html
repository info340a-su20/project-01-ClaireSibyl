            <p>
                For those of you that have not played it, this lovely game is a metroidvania bullet-hell developed by <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/gemayue?lang=en">GemaYue</a></cite> and 
                <cite><a href="https://www.crespirit.com/home">CreSpirit</a></cite>, published by <cite><a href="https://sekaiproject.com/">Sekai Project</a></cite>, 
                <cite><a href="https://pqube.co.uk/">PQube</a></cite>, and <cite><a href="http://www.cir-ent.com/">Circle Entertainment</a></cite>! 
                It's super fun and has difficulties for all types of players, so if you haven't tried it, I'd recommend giving it a go!!
            </p>

            <p>
                    This website is to help aspiring Rabi-ribi players learn how to dodge boss attack patterns without having to
                    scour the internet for a video that demonstrates it for them! It can be useful to pinpoint the exact attack
                    a player is looking for without having to skim a video, hoping that somebody does it without getting hit or needing
                    a forced invincibility frame. This site comes with a loop button to loop the attack for the person,
                    so that they don't constantly need to rewind the same segment over-and-over again! Alternatively, users may also
                    use video controls to pause and play as desired. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                    For now this site focuses solely on the hardest bosses in the game: SP Rita, SP Syaro, SP Miru, and SP Irisu.
                    In the future I hope to update it to include all bosses at the BEX (Bunny Extinction) difficulty as well. Note: the
                    reason why I don't do any easier difficulty is because attacks are still mostly the same, just perhaps slower or less bullets.
                    Difficulties above BEX are non-standard, and from what I've read and interpreted, it seems that those difficulties aren't made
                    in mind for players to dodge every attack without needing forced invincibility frames; thus, I focused on BEX.
